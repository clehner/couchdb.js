couchdb.js
==========

`couchdb.js` is a standalone library for CouchDB browser clients.
It is based on the `jquery.couch.js` library included in CouchDB,
but modified to not depend on jQuery. It still depends on `sha1.js`
for user signups.

`couchdb.js` also contains some improvements in the robustness of `db.changes`
